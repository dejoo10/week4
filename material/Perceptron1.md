# Perceptron vs Neuron

Both perceptron and neuron are fundamental concepts in neural network theory, but they are not exactly the same. Let's delve into their definitions and differences:

### Perceptron

1. **Definition**: A perceptron is a single-layer neural network used for binary classification tasks. It receives multiple input signals, applies weights to them, sums them up, and passes the sum through an activation function to produce an output.

2. **Activation Function**: Typically uses a step function as the activation function, which outputs 1 if the weighted sum of inputs is above a threshold (bias) and 0 otherwise.

3. **Learning Rule**: Uses the perceptron learning rule, also known as the Delta rule or Hebbian learning, to update its weights based on the error in the prediction.

4. **Limitation**: Limited to linearly separable data and cannot solve problems that require non-linear decision boundaries.

### Neuron (Artificial Neuron)

1. **Definition**: A neuron, also known as an artificial neuron or node, is a computational unit in an artificial neural network. It receives one or multiple inputs, applies weights to them, sums them up, and passes the sum through an activation function to produce an output.

2. **Activation Function**: Can use various activation functions like sigmoid, ReLU, tanh, etc., depending on the network architecture and task.

3. **Learning Rule**: Can use various learning algorithms like gradient descent, backpropagation, etc., to update its weights based on the error in the prediction. It's not limited to a specific learning rule like the perceptron.

4. **Flexibility**: Can be part of a single-layer (perceptron) or multi-layer (neural network) structure, allowing it to model complex non-linear relationships.

### Summary

- **Perceptron**: A specific type of neuron used for binary classification with a step activation function and the perceptron learning rule. It's a simplified version of an artificial neuron and is limited to linearly separable problems.

- **Neuron**: A more general computational unit used in artificial neural networks, capable of using various activation functions and learning algorithms. It can be part of both single-layer and multi-layer network architectures, making it more flexible for modeling complex problems.

In essence, a perceptron can be considered a special case or a building block of a more complex artificial neuron used in modern neural network architectures.
